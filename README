My Steps:

0. Source code for:
https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Set+up+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK+and+Build+a+Project

1. There is a tutorial on Atlassian, but there is no clear way how to make thing work. 
I ended up with cloning helloworld from bitbucket and after some time changed JIRA and AMPS versions. 
So it started to work after it.

2. https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ATLASSDK-93 says to change atlas-mvn:
rem set MVN_COMMAND=
rem call set MVN_COMMAND=%%MVN_COMMAND:${mavenPluginName}=%MVN_PLUGIN%%%
call set MVN_COMMAND=%%MVN_COMMAND:%%

3. Exclude module-info: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Answers-Developer-Questions/Re-Re-JIRA-plugin-with-JDK-1-8/qaq-p/1094785/comment-id/118810#M118810
