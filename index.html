<h3>My Steps:</h3>
<p>
1. There is a tutorial on Atlassian:
<a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/create-a-helloworld-plugin-project/">https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/create-a-helloworld-plugin-project/</a>.
But there is no clear way how to make thing work. 
I ended up with cloning helloworld from Atlassian's Bitbucket.
Then changed JIRA and AMPS versions, so it started to work after it.
In parallel I read how another developer is struggling with making tutorial work: 
<a href="https://www.zuehlke.com/blog/en/a-plugin-for-atlassian-jira-getting-started/">https://www.zuehlke.com/blog/en/a-plugin-for-atlassian-jira-getting-started/</a>
</p>
<p>
2. Another change I made was advised here:
<a href="https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ATLASSDK-93">https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ATLASSDK-93</a> 
It says to change atlas-mvn in the following way:
<pre>
rem set MVN_COMMAND=
rem call set MVN_COMMAND=%%MVN_COMMAND:${mavenPluginName}=%MVN_PLUGIN%%%
call set MVN_COMMAND=%%MVN_COMMAND:%%
</pre>
</p>

3.
